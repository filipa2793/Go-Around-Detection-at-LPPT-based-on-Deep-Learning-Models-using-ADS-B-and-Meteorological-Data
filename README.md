# Go-Around-Detection-at-LPPT-based-on-Deep-Learning-Models-using-ADS-B-and-Meteorological-Data

This repository contains all the flight data and meteorological data gathered throughout the months and the post-processing dataset at Humberto Delgado Airport (LPPT). The flight data came from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transmissions and it was collected from two distinct sources: through a Software Defined Radio (SDR) setup and from the historical dataset provided by the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/). The meteorological data was collected from Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) using the Python's [get-metars](https://pypi.org/project/get-metars) and short-term forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provided by [Instituto PortuguÃªs do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA)](https://www.ipma.pt/pt/index.html). The final dataset has 243 522 flights, starting from June 2023 to August 2025, with a go-around percentage of 0.48\%. The following figure shows the methodological process.
