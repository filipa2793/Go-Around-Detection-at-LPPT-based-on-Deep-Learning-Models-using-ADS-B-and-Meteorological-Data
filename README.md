# Go-Around Detection at LPPT based on Deep Learning Models using ADS-B and Meteorological Data

Go-arounds are a standard manoeuvre during the final approach, often initiated by pilots flying or requested by air traffic controllers to abort the landing procedures. While there are few go-arounds, they represent a safety critical manoeuvre that impact negatively airport operations and air traffic control (ATC). Humberto Delgado Airport (LPPT) is the largest airport in Portugal and one of the busiest airports in Europe, despite having only two terminals and one runway, and it has experienced a significant growth in passengers and aircraft movements. This study investigates the use of **deep learning models**, to detect go-around events in the final approach phase at LPPT using ADS-B and meteorological data. Results show that the **attention-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model** achieves a promising performance, identifying **50% to 60% of go-arounds**, comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches. Meteorological features, such as **turbulence and wind related features, aircraft energy and glideslope** were particularly informative. Overall, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of go-around risk at LPPT and supports the study and development of early-warning tools for air traffic control.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The flight data came from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transmissions and it was collected from two distinct sources: through a Software Defined Radio (SDR) setup and from the historical dataset provided by the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/). The meteorological data was collected from Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) using the Python's [get-metars](https://pypi.org/project/get-metars) and short-term forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provided by [Instituto Portugu√™s do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA)](https://www.ipma.pt/pt/index.html). The final dataset has 243 522 flights, starting from June 2023 to August 2025, with a go-around percentage of 0.48\%. The following figure shows the methodological process.
